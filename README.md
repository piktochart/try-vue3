# try-vue3

A prototype Vue application generated by vue-cli to showcase the capabilities and changes in the current released version of Vue3.

The prototype is built from [vue-cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/) to generate the Vue app, and [vue-cli-plugin-vue-next](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli-plugin-vue-next) to upgrade it to the Vue3.

The initial setup toggles all the features available:

And for specific settings, `babel + ts`, `class based component`, `cypress`, `jest`, and `node-sass` are used.
